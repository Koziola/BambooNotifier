# Bamboo Desktop Notifications on macOS
Get notified when Atlassian Bamboo build plans you care about pass or fail.
## How to use:
1. Open and run BambooNotifier.xcworkspace.  The app will run in the status bar.
2. Authentication via the app hasn't been added yet, so you have to be logged into your Bamboo instance separately (i.e. via a browser window).
